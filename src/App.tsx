          <p>
            Your cells marked with üòÄ emoji, and your enemy cells marked with
            üíÄ.
          </p>
          <p>Your goal is to take more cells than your enemy.</p>
          <p>Now your enemy is silly bot that chose actions randomly.</p>
          <p>
            To expand your territory just choose color to repaint. And tap any
            cell with this color.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that you can only choose colors which cells are connected with
            your territory.
